Hello, 

Your uncanny faith in what we have, what developed along the way, to uncertainties ahead. Is most of my muse these days. I did not bring anything to the table, nothing beyond necessities. Yet you morphed whatever scrap we had, mold its concoction of an existence to a meaningful whole. You could have moved on, you could have ended it all, you can still just fade to a life of your own. Which is fine, I too will wither away, in parts, slowly, one shade at a time. 

If only I could swim in your eyes, through those dark trenches that separate us. I will fight against the wind, shade you in all means. Just the thought of you brings all the colors back to life. Sharing a cup of coffee with you, now that is a story I would love to write. 

thanks,
Hamdan
