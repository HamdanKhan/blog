      <description>Staying at home
We&amp;rsquo;ve been under lockdown from 20th March here in Karachi, went to the office on 20th that is, it was Friday, also the last day I went to Masjid. Was in office due to a pending &amp;ldquo;high priority issue&amp;rdquo; which was on someone else&amp;rsquo;s plate, but he had to run back home to interior Sindh amid lockdown risk. From then on till now it is all work from home and our team has adopted it well.</description>

      <description>Hello,
Your uncanny faith in what we have, what developed along the way, to uncertainties ahead. Is most of my muse these days. I did not bring anything to the table, nothing beyond necessities. Yet you morphed whatever scrap we had, mold its concoction of an existence to a meaningful whole. You could have moved on, you could have ended it all, you can still just fade to a life of your own.</description>

      <description>Puppets! He mutters, not free, in a monolog, while unpacking the stage. Our biase, our presupposition, our belief, he continued. Its a story, add a pinch of salt at will. You can not see my harness, am I at my own will? with a concerned look on his face, while he sets two of his characters on the stage. These were not elaborate, those puppets, yet distinguishable, a male and a female.</description>

      <title>A Letter to Muse</title>

      <description>Dear Muse,
Stuck in an endless loop of writing this letter and deleting it. Every time with a slightly different meaning, the goal? I am not clear on that. I simply can not get a grip on this untangled mess. Few of those letters had our differences listed, few emotionally charged, few aggressive, some more apologetic than others. That is not all, they even had profound shit like the utilitarian conclusion and stoic viewpoints.</description>

      <description>In the midst of chaos I reside, a distant observer to my own life.
I am on a thought created dungeon, this calm endless sea.
Rowing voices of my oarsmen into the abyss,
me expressionless, at the bow of this ship.
Staring at the shimmering reflection of this star lit sky.
Every time I close my eyes, deserts, mountains,
lush green planes, life at its apex, all that is unseen.</description>
