Staying at home

We've been under lockdown from 20th March here in Karachi, went to the office on 20th that is, it was Friday, also the last day I went to Masjid. Was in office due to a pending "high priority issue" which was on someone else's plate, but he had to run back home to interior Sindh amid lockdown risk.  From then on till now it is all work from home and our team has adopted it well.

Other than that I got time to install Arch and FreeBsd on Virtual box and its GUI tried a bunch of options Gnome + gdm worked, for FreeBSD I installed xfce4.
