Dear Muse, 

Stuck in an endless loop of writing this letter and deleting it. Every time with a slightly different meaning, the goal? I am not clear on that. I simply can not get a grip on this untangled mess. Few of those letters had our differences listed, few emotionally charged, few aggressive, some more apologetic than others. That is not all, they even had profound shit like the utilitarian conclusion and stoic viewpoints. I am fragmenting things here, though this letter is about putting them back together. Life, me, everything is not perfect, nor I am expecting you to be. Hope there is some forgiveness left for me, and for my stupid puppets and their rhymes. In any case, I will be waiting here, behind this screen. 

thanks,  
Hamdan
