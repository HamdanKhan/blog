      <description>Puppeteer Puppets! He mutters, not free, in a monolog, while unpacking the stage. Our biase, our presupposition, our belief, he continued. Its a story, add a pinch of salt at will. You can not see my harness, am I at my own will? with a concerned look on his face, while he sets two of his characters on the stage. These were not elaborate, those puppets, yet distinguishable, a male and a female.</description>

      <description>Dear Muse,
Stuck in an endless loop of writing this letter and deleting it. Every time with a slightly different meaning, the goal? I am not clear on that. I simply can not get a grip on this untangled mess. Few of those letters had our differences listed, few emotionally charged, few aggressive, some more apologetic than others. That is not all, they even had profound shit like the utilitarian conclusion and stoic viewpoints.</description>

      <description>Chaos In the midst of chaos I reside, a distant observer to my own life.
I am on a thought created dungeon, this calm endless sea.
Rowing voices of my oarsmen into the abyss,
me expressionless, at the bow of this ship.
Staring at the shimmering reflection of this star lit sky.
Every time I close my eyes, deserts, mountains,
lush green planes, life at its apex, all that is unseen.</description>
